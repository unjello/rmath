= rmath

_rmath_ is a header-only, dependency free, library bringing shader-like syntax (GLSL, HSLS) into C++.

== Synopsis

```c++

#include <rmath/all.hpp>

using namespace rmath;

int main() {

  vec4 foo { 0 };                  // 0,0,0,0
  yx(foo) = vec2(2, 1);            // 1,2,0,0
  zw(foo) = xy(foo) * 2;           // 1,2,2,4
}
```

https://github.com/gwiazdorrr/CxxSwizzle[CxxSwizzle] :: Very nice library, _chapeau bas_, with great swizzling approach. One huge issue is that the library relies on a C-like trick for accessing members _via_ union:
+
[source, c++]
----
struct vec3 {
  union {
    struct { x, y, z };
    float data[3];
  }
};
----
+
which is, unfortunately, a perfect case of *Undefined Behavior* in C++. For now it works, and everybody seems to rely on that, but compilers could as well optimize the-whole-chunk-of-accessing-inactive-members-of-union out.

http://glm.g-truc.net/[GLM] :: Has more features, is more mature, but also very macro-heavy (for same reason https://github.com/gwiazdorrr/CxxSwizzle[CxxSwizzle] was born) and uses the same `union` trick as https://github.com/gwiazdorrr/CxxSwizzle[CxxSwizzle], which is an *Undefined Behavior* in C++.
